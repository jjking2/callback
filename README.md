# Callback.java

A Java class for improving callback readability.

## Introduction

This class can be used to write a callback code next to the calling point, not at the callback point.
This enables you to quickly find a callback code for the calling code.

## How to use

See Test.java for how to use Callback.java.

If you run Test.java, you will see the following output:

```
runX called
onX called
callback for X called
 random = 0.029909556029656614
runY called
onYorZ called with isY = true
callback for Y called
```
